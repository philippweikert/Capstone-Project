# Plantacapstone

## Short Intro:
A little App for people, who are struggling to keep alive their plants at home.
Right now it is just a list you can create with certain information. But it is planned to add some more features.

So, if you are interested, check it out, create your account and off you go!

## Little Tech-Stack:
I'm using Java and TypeScript language-wise. As frameworks I'm using Spring/Spring Boot and React.
